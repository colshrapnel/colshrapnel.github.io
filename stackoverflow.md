title: "It's time to admit that Stack Overflow is not so good at answering questions"

And no, it's not about chatGPT. The problem is much older and deeper. 

### The Great Controversy

On the first glance, Stack Overflow appears to be OK: yes, it has answers to your questions. But, save for the most popular topics, the answers' quality is *questionable*. And even answers, that can be called satisfactory, became so due to going *against* the rules rather than following them: writing a good answer is a constant and collaborative effort. But Stack Overflow never encourages improvement of existing answers, least a collaboration. But only a competitive effort in adding more and more answers. 

Stack Overflow is built on controversy.

By calling itself [not a forum](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/92110/214960), it effectively bans any discussion, running experience for the most vulnerable audience: people that came to ask  for *assistance*, rather than asking a generic question. Which is quite confusing for a Q&A site, and leaves many people disappointed. There is a [loud outcry](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/u49a6j/sad_truth/) from people who get their question closed in seconds.

On the other hand, the famous "[gamification](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2018/04/13/gamification/)" reward system, being centered around *personal* contribution but never on a collaborative effort, effectively makes each question a *forum thread* that consists of [assorted attempts to provide an answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/743806/how-do-i-split-a-string-into-a-list-of-words) - as opposed to a well-written single generic answer. Which is, again, quite confusing and hard to use.

And even gamification itself is not so bright nowadays. With so many questions already answered, most new questions are either off topic or duplicates, so they ought to be closed. Which makes it hard for new willing participants to earn even a few reputations points! 

A Q&A site is expected to provide two different kinds of answers: ad-hoc support for people coming in person and sort of a knowledge base with ready made answers to generic questions. And, I dare to say, Stack Overflow fails with both.  

At first it looked a good idea, to build the knowledge base by means of answering questions. In the hindsight, it turned to be a catastrophe. These goals are mutual exclusive, if pursued simultaneously. And they must be separated.
